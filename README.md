There is a problem with not being able to confirm if a transaction was picked up. Not recommended for use until resolved!<br />
Dero pong server with UI. Designed on PHP 7.4  <br />
Another take on the Dero pong server by CaptainDero and SecretNameBasis.  <br />
Create a db with name pong. dbconn.php contains the credentials.  <br />
Set your Engram wallet cyberdeck user and password in walletapi.php. <br />
Begin creating products on index.php. <br />
To use the UUID and endpoint feature, check "Only Use UUID" in product settings, enter the web address for your custom web api (Out Message). Roll your own api call to be called on line 240 of process.php <br />
Deactivated Integrated Addresses will automatically refund any payment, with message "Integrated Address Inactive.".<br />
If it doesn't automatically drain your wallet then you may donate here instead Dero username:WebGuy<br /><br />
